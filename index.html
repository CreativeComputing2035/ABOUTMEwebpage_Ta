            <h1 class=center> MY STORY </h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that though a certain aspect of abiotic and biotic’s identity isn’t showing, it doesn’t mean that they stop embodying those experiences. I am not just a  prospective Parson transfer student, but also the Thai gay boy who struggled in an all boy school, the amateur masseur with a degree, a monk in training and Chinese and Canadian boarding school survivor.
	My identity has always been important to me; I’ve spent half my life hiding, a quarter seeking, and the rest embracing my actions and consequences. 
	To me, artists’ power not only lay on the fact that we can monetise a moment, but also our ability to bring interest back to the forgotten, like Theatre Gates’ Dorchester Projects, and emphasis to the current issue like Ai Wei Wei’s pose as drowned Syrian infant refugee. Art counters people’s daily acts of destruction with the act of creation. I make art. I encourage social interaction under the name of art, through site-specific performance piece, virtual-based poster, heart-warming painting, daily nature sketches and essentially being alive and happy. Art practice requires me to be globally-aware.3
	My creative career kickstarted from the need to make handmade gift to the people I care about. Since I moved around a lot as a kid, my biggest fear was oblivion of those memories and being forgotten. Art helps keep me relevant and connected.
                <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2014, while I was struggling to take a ‘good picture’ of a festival in Mongolia during my internship, my mentor told me to go dance with the crowd. When I came back to work, I somehow enjoyed it more. That night, she told me that if I want to take a ‘good picture,’ my work needs to be meaningful to me. When I want to capture a moment because I want to remember it, that’s when I will take a ‘good picture.’ Since then, that was how I mainly approach art.
	After my academic-driven art education in Parson, I hope to join social-based organisation as their creative liaison. I only have a year to work abroad before I need to go home and serve in the military for two years as stated by the law. However, I hope that I will get assigned to a field that can utilise my degree like the PR sector, to better communicate the military’s action to the people, hence, giving more transparency to an aspect of Thai po√ litical system. While making connection to grass-roots organisation along the way. My ultimate dream is to join the United Nations and oversee community art project, and use my design background to connect it with the globalised world.
	The very act of creating is deeply life-affirming and satisfying. I create art to make my subject relevant in different lights, to promote interactions among my audience, to say ‘thank you’ and to make myself relevant to others and vice versa. Art has been a medium that helped me expressed who I am, now it will be the medium that I will use to change the world. </p>
